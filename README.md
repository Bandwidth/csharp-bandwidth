# Bandwidth.Net
[![Build](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/bhv8hs3fx9k6c33i?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/avbel/csharp-bandwidth)

.NET library for [Bandwidth's App Platform](ap.bandwidth.com/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=dtolb&utm_content=)


With Bandwidth.Net  you have access to the entire set of API methods including:
* **Account** - get user's account data and transactions,
* **Application** - manage user's applications,
* **AvailableNumber** - search free local or toll-free phone numbers,
* **Bridge** - control bridges between calls,
* **Call** - get access to user's calls,
* **Conference** - manage user's conferences,
* **ConferenceMember** - make actions with conference members,
* **Domain** - get access to user's domains,
* **EntryPoint** - control of endpoints of domains,
* **Error** - list of errors,
* **Media** - list, upload and download files to Bandwidth API server,
* **Message** - send SMS/MMS, list messages,
* **NumberInfo** - receive CNUM info by phone number,
* **PhoneNumber** - get access to user's phone numbers,
* **Recording** - mamange user's recordings.

Also you can work with Bandwidth XML using special types (in namespaces `Bandwidth.Net.Xml` and `Bandwidth.Net.Xml.Verbs`). 
## Install

Run

```
nuget install Bandwidth.Net
```

Or install `Bandwidth.Net` via UI in Visual Studio.
## Getting Started

* Install `Bandwidth.Net`,
* **Get user id, api token and secret** - to use the Catapult API you need these data.  You can get them [here](https://catapult.inetwork.com/pages/catapult.jsf) on the tab "Account",
* **Set user id, api token and secret** - you can do that with 2 ways:

```
//Using client directly
var client = Client.GetInstance("userId", "apiToken", "apiSecret");

//Or you can use default client instance.
//Do that only once
Client.GlobalOptions = new ClientOptions
{
    UserId = "userId",
    ApiToken = "apiToken",
    ApiSecret = "apiSecret"
};


```
## Usage

All static functions support 2 ways to be called: with client instance as first arg or without client instance (default client instance will be used then)

```
//Using client directly
var client = Client.GetInstance("userId", "apiToken", "apiSecret");
var call = await Call.List(client, new Dictionary<string, object>{{"page", 1}});

//Or you can use default client instance.
//You should set up its global options before using of api functions.

var call = await Call.List(new Dictionary<string, object>{{"page", 1}});

```
